Hi, my name is Veselin and I'm from Bulgaria.

I am a Rubyist, Rails fan, linux master and open-source enthusiast. I love programming and I love solving out of the ordinary problems.

In my free time I usually get my hands dirty with the most up-to-date technologies and tools. One of my favourite things to do is to optimize my development process.

If you want to find more about me or my work, you can visit my social profiles. Don't hesitate to say "Hi".
